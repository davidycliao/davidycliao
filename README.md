## Hi, welcome to my GitHub page :bowtie: <img src="https://raw.githack.com/yl17124/DMASS/master/logo/Essex.jpg" width="220" height= "60" align="right" />  <br />  

I am a PhD student in the Department of Government, the University of Essex, working on Taiwan legislative politics (and beyond). My research interests are mainly in political polarisation on congressional roll calls and speeches, and particularly in how electoral motives shape preference, representation and ideological positionings. 

Apart from my PhD project, Iâ€™m currently working on applying computational techniques to understand legislative speeches using various natural language processing techniques and building up a related repo for [ParlspeechV2](https://github.com/yl17124/Parliament-Speech-Processing-Python) dataset using UDpipe and SpaCy in Python. Free free to check my [research profile](https://yl17124.github.io/project/) :open_file_folder: and latest [curriculum vitae](https://raw.githack.com/yl17124/CV/master/CV.pdf) :clipboard: out.

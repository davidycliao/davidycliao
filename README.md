I am a PhD student in the Department of Government, the University of Essex. My research interests are mainly in __distributive politics__ and __roll call polarization__ within congress, and particularly in how electoral motives shape preference, representation and ideological positionings. 

Apart from my dissertation project, I am interested in applying various natural language processing techniques to understand political discourse as well as ues deep learning for speech processing in my new research project.

If you’re interested in researches related to legislative politics, quantitative study of ideology and political attitudes, the application of natural language processing in Mandarin and computational social science (particularly in topics related to legislatures and parties). Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.Free free to check out my [research profile](https://davidycliao.github.io/research/) :open_file_folder: and latest [curriculum vitae](https://raw.githack.com/davidycliao/cv_show/main/CV.pdf) :clipboard:.

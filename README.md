## Hi, welcome to my GitHub page :bowtie: <img src="https://raw.githack.com/yl17124/DMASS/master/logo/Essex.jpg" width="175" height= "50" align="right" />  <br />  

I am a PhD student in the Department of Government, the University of Essex, working on Taiwan legislative politics (and beyond). My research interests are mainly in __distributive politics__ and __roll call polarization__ within congress, and particularly in how electoral motives shape preference, representation and ideological positionings. 

Apart from my PhD project, I’m currently working on applying computational techniques to understand legislative speeches using various natural language processing techniques and building up a related tutorials for [ParlspeechV2](https://github.com/yl17124/Parliament-Speech-Processing-Python) dataset using UDpipe and SpaCy. Free free to check my [research profile](https://yl17124.github.io/research/) :open_file_folder: and latest [curriculum vitae](https://raw.githack.com/yl17124/CV/master/CV.pdf) :clipboard: out.

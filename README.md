My name is David (Yen-Chieh) Liao. I obtained a PhD from Department of Goverment at University of Essex. I was a Pre-doctoral Researcher of [<span style="color:#778899">Legislators between Accountability and Collective Agency</span>](https://projectlacan.wordpress.com/team/) at the Chair of Comparative Politics in University of Bamberg. I am a visiting fellow in the Bamberg Graduate School of Social Sciences with [<span style="color:#778899">Prof. Thomas Saalfeld</span>](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/vp-research/).

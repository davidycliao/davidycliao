I am a PhD candidate at The Department of Government, The University of Essex. My research agenda and dissertation are focused on __distributive politics__ and __roll call polarization__ within Taiwan‚Äôs legislature (the Legislative Yuan). I am particularly interested in how electoral motives shape preference, representation and ideological positionings. Apart from my dissertation project, I apply various natural language processing techniques to study parliamentary speeches and political discourse during the Cultural Revolution as well as accommodate deep learning approach to measure internal conflict and inter-party divisions from facial and vocal expressions of the legislators.


If you‚Äôre looking for any more collaborators for research projects related to legislative politics, quantitative study of political ideology and attitude, the application of natural language processing (particularily in Mandarin), and computational social science.  Please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me.

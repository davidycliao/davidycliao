## Hi, welcome to my GitHub page :bowtie:

<br />

I am a PhD student in the Department of Government, the University of Essex, working on Taiwan legislative politics (and beyond). My research interests mainly focus on the quantitative study of ideology and political attitudes as well as computational
techniques and application in social science.

:construction_worker: Apart from my PhD project, Iâ€™m currently working on applying computational techniques to understand legislative behaviour using various natural language processing techniques and building up a related repo for [ParlspeechV2]() dataset using Python and relevant libraries such as UDpipe and SpaCy. Free free to check my [ðŸ“‚](https://yl17124.github.io/project/) research profile and latest :clipboard: [CV](https://raw.githack.com/yl17124/CV/master/CV.pdf) out.
